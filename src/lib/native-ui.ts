/**
 * The small pieces that make the wrapped app feel like an app rather than a page:
 * a status bar that follows the theme, a splash screen that hides once there is
 * something to show, the Android back button, and a tap you can feel.
 *
 * Everything here is a no-op in a browser. The guards are explicit rather than relying
 * on the plugins' web fallbacks, so a future plugin swap cannot quietly start throwing.
 */

/**
 * The status bar icons, matched to whatever is actually painted behind them.
 *
 * Measured on Android 16 (targetSdk 36): the web view does **not** run edge to edge —
 * it is inset by 24 CSS px top and bottom, `env(safe-area-inset-*)` reads 0 inside it,
 * and those two strips are painted with the window background. That background comes
 * from the `DayNight` theme, so it follows the **system** dark mode and ignores the
 * theme chosen inside the app. `setBackgroundColor` cannot repaint it either — Android
 * 15 made it a no-op — and neither `setOverlaysWebView`, `fitsSystemWindows="false"`,
 * nor `WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(window, false)` moved the web view.
 *
 * Hence the system preference here rather than the app's own theme. Driving the icons
 * from the app's theme is the intuitive thing to write and produces white icons on a
 * white strip the moment someone picks Dark on a light phone. Icons that follow the
 * strip's real colour stay readable in every combination.
 *
 * The remaining cost is honest and small: with the app's theme overridden against the
 * system, those two strips keep the system's colour. Making them follow the app would
 * mean genuine edge-to-edge work against AppCompat's decor, or switching the Android
 * night mode at runtime — which recreates the activity and reloads the web view.

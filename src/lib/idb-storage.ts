/**
 * IndexedDB-backed storage for the store that holds real data: the library.
 *
 * localStorage served well until two of its limits started to matter. Its ~5 MB ceiling
 * is why game descriptions are stripped before writing and why a quota guard existed at
 * all; IndexedDB quotas are measured in hundreds of megabytes. And on iOS the plan is to
 * wrap the app natively, where the WebView's localStorage is the first thing the OS
 * reclaims under pressure — IndexedDB is both sturdier there and the format the native
 * storage plugin migrates from.
 *
 * The values are still the same JSON strings zustand's persist writes; only the shelf
 * they sit on changes. Each value lives under its store name in one object store.
